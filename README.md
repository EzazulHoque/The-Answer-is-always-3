The Answer is always 3
This is a simple guessing program where it asks the user to guess a number then multiply it and finally substract it but no matter what the number is, it will always return 3 because of a formula.
This was made in Xcode. 
If you enter a very lengthy number e.g.(12235412581234235124) it will give you an error because of the data limits.
